<h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

<h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Neuroplasticity is the brain&#39;s amazing capacity to change and adapt. It refers to the physiological changes in the brain that happen as the result of our interactions with our environment. From the time the brain begins to develop in utero until the day we die, the connections among the cells in our brains reorganize in response to our changing needs. This dynamic process allows us to learn from and adapt to different experiences.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Understanding that intelligence is not fixed and that we can literally change the structure of our brains and how it functions can be hugely empowering for some people. It can boost morale to know that with practice we can get better at an activity and not have to accept that we have a certain intelligence level or way of thinking. </p>

<h2>How I plan to engage with neuroplasticity</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">For me understanding that with repeated practice i can become better at something is hugely empowering. Having that understanding that the more you do an activity the better you will get will be important to remember when faced with a difficult task. We can teach our brains to do something. we can change the structure of it and how we think. We are not born with fixed intelligence or a particular way of thinking. Also knowing that the best way to learn will be to utilise existing neurological pathways and relating what is being taught to my own life. </p>

<h2>Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">A few of the methods that have been shown to enhance or boost neuroplasticity include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Intermittent fasting&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Traveling</li>
	<li>Using mnemonic devices</li>
	<li>Learning a musical instrument</li>
	<li>Non-dominant hand exercises</li>
	<li>Reading fiction</li>
	<li>Expanding your vocabulary</li>
	<li>Creating artwork</li>
	<li>Dancing</li>
	<li>Sleeping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

<h2>What is it and why is it relevant?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">A growth mindset is a a belief that your intelligence, ability, personality can all be shaped and developed over time and are not fixed or static (fixed mindset)</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Through hard-work, practice and dedication you can achieve success. This ties in directly with the study of neuroplasticity in that the brain is malleable and can be influenced by daily activities and thoughts. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">You can develop a different attitude to difficulty and effort if you understand that by doing this your brain is developing and making stronger connections. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">It is relevant because a lot of your success can come from your belief that your abilities can be developed. Enjoying learning will help you to learn. </p>

<h2>What I found surprising about Growth Mindset</h2>

<p>Perhaps what surprised me was how much the belief in a growth mindset actually plays in having success. I was always of the opinion that things like intelligence or ability can be developed over time but even being conscious of it and understanding that learning is a journey and not a destination. It is the path that leads to stronger neural connections and growth of ability. </p>

<h2>How I plan to integrate Growth Mindset into my learning journey</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">For me it has cemented my opinion that your attitude to learning is key to how successful you will become. If you dedicate yourself and practice, become resilient there is not a lot that cannot be achieved. Start with small wins, build your confidence and develop your growth mindset. Remembering that there is no &#39;Fail&#39; only a &#39;not yet&#39;. Praise myself for effort and difficulty and change them into something fun and challenging.</p>
