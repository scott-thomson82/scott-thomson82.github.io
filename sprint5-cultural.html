<h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I think for me one of the best takeaways from the core material has been the emphasis on reflection and how reflection can be used to cement learning. I probably had a different approach to learning previously which involved more note taking and revision but I now place a bigger emphasis on reflection and testing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I have enjoyed the mindfulness aspect that was introduced and hope to keep this up and create a habit out of it. I learned that I didn’t find it as easy as I expected to! This is probably even more of a reason to practice it. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">The other part of the core content I got value from was researching the role of EQ and how important it is to develop that aspect of yourself if you want to grow as a person. </p>

<h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Programming is a difficult thing to learn. It’s important to have that empathy towards yourself if things are not going as you would like or you are encountering problems but also be kind and empathetic to your fellow cohort and what they are going through. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">In terms of learning, having that self awareness about what does and doesn’t work for me and the style of learning that I respond to is going to really help in bootcamp. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses will be crucial. </p>

<h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Probably the amount of self-examination that has been involved. I perhaps was not expecting as much of that but its been very interesting. </p>

<h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">As mentioned probably the level of self-examination. Its not something that i would generally tend to dwell on and think about too much but the more I thought about it the easier it became throughout the content. </p>

<h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I think there are lots of reasons it’s taught and valuable. Learning about yourself and knowing the best way for you to learn is really going to be valuable. We are going to be working on projects and developing as a team so having that awareness of yourself and other people is really going to be crucial. Bootcamp is also going to be a very intense experience so I think its definitely going to help equip people on how to handle those situations. </p>

<h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">No I don’t think so. Understanding yourself a bit more and how your learn and deal with situations will no doubt be handy skills to have when bootcamp starts. </p>

<h2>Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I think it’s been a good balance overall of core and technical material. </p>
