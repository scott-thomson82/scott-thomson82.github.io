        <h2>Identity, strengths and values exploration</h2>

        <h2>Core Values </h2>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">There are many personal values that I identify with to a certain degree but if I was
            to reduce it down to the core in no particular order they would be;</p>
        <ul>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Open mindedness</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px">Spirit of adventure</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px">Positivity</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px">Compassion</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px">Perseverance</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px">Loyalty</p>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">When I think about many of the important decisions that I have made in my life and
            the thought process behind them I see these values influencing those decisions time and time again. I
            believe that being openminded is fundamental in helping you grow, every day is truly a school day and your
            education is never finished. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">Life exists outside of your comfort zone. It is only when you leave comfort behind
            that you can experience the full palette of emotion that life has to offer. These new experience and
            challenges will help you to learn about yourself, what you are capable of and lead you to become a more
            rounded and hopefully a better person. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">I believe in the power of staying positive. I try to achieve this through perspective
            and gratitude. For me being positive is something that I have tried to develop and get better with practice.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">Be kind, you never know the struggles that someone else is going through. Theres a
            reason it feels satisfying to help someone. We are altruistic and compassionate animals by nature. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">I believe that hard work and perseverance are the key to success. There is a
            satisfaction that comes from completing something that was achieved with hard work that is unlike anything
            else. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">Working in customer service I was often tasked with making tough ethical decisions
            which would directly affect a customer. My process for making such a decision always began with one question
            that I would ask myself. “What’s the right thing to do?” Not the easiest or the most convenient but the
            right thing. Using this as a starting point would provide guidance when making a tough decision. My next
            step would be to put myself in the customers shoes and ask how I would feel if I was in their situation?
            Thinking about this would usually allow me to reach a decision on how to proceed. </p>

        <h2>Cultural Influence</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">I come from a very working class city in the north of England. The people from this
            area are known for being very down to earth and hardworking. These are traits that I try and carry with me.
        </p>

        <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">I consider myself to be quite disciplined and determined. If I have a task or a goal
            I want to achieve I can usually figure out how I want to approach it, devise a plan and stick to it without
            getting sidetracked easily. I don’t generally get flustered too easily and I can remain quite calm in
            stressful situations, I have a feeling these traits will be tested a lot during Dev Academy! </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">In terms of limitations I have quite an analytical personality so I can be quite
            demanding and self critical of myself and I sometimes set standards too high which can be quite detrimental
            if not kept in check. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">Being a former team leader I encountered many instances of resistance or tension when
            trying to manage a team and work productivly. In terms of strategies I would employ to deal with this
            firstly I think its very important to lead by example and set the standard yourself first. If tension is
            arising in a work environment it can also mean that someone perhaps does not feel valued or heard so it’s
            important to create an inclusive environment where people do feel valued. </p>
