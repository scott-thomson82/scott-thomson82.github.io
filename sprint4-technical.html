<h3>When I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Sometimes the problem can be a lot simpler than it first initially looks. There were a couple of instances were I was probably overthinking what I had to do when the answer was straight in front of me. I remember a couple of instances where code would not run correctly because I had not noticed that there was a curly bracket missing! Simple things like checking the syntax can often be the answer to a lot of issues. </p>

<h3>When I solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Im not sure how elegant it was but when I was trying to complete the SuperFizzBuzz challenge in the Repl.it Kata’s I was trying to find out a way to make the console print the word ‘FizzBuzz’ when it reached a multiple of 3 or 5. It wasn’t doing this because this conditional statement was the last condition. It took me probably longer than it should have to figure out that all I had to do was to put this statement first and it would work. It was literally done through trial and error and moving around the order of the statements , testing them until it finally worked. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">What helped me through both of these problems was checking error messages and trying to understand them but also trial and error. If I am not getting the result I want then try something else and get a little closer to the answer. It can be frustrating to encounter problems but it’s important to step back and take a break when needed. One of the main things that I learned as I have mentioned earlier is that sometimes the problem is a lot simpler than it seems you just have to work though it, understand it and hopefully the answer is not too far away. </p>

<h3>Reflecting on different problem solving techniques and process:</h3>

<h3>Pseudocode</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I really found using pseudocode helpful when attempting these problems. Even the act of breaking down the problem into steps and just verbalising what needed to be done was helpful. Its definitely something a want to get into the habit of doing whenever I have a problem to solve.</p>

<h3>Trying something</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Probably something I didn’t do enough of. I have a tendency of trying to figure out the solution completely without trying different things along the way so this is definitely something need to do more of. </p>

<h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">My cat has definitely listened to a lot of my problems over the last couple of weeks! I think verbalising the error can definitely be useful in recognising my understanding of the problem. </p>

<h3>Reading error messages</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I find the error messages in my text editor extremely useful and its something I will go to very quickly if there is a problem. If its a syntax issue I can usually figure it our from here very quickly. </p>

<h3>Console.logging</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Similar to not trying things out I definitely do not use this method enough. It’s very useful to help you orientate yourself when a problem arises so I need to build more of a habit and use this a lot more often. </p>

<h3>Googling</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Probably my go to default method when trying to solve an issue. The answer to my question is almost certainly here somewhere but it can be very overwhelming trawling through the internet. I find it very easy to get lost down a bit of a rabbit hole so I think discipline is crucial if using this method and maybe just sticking to a few trusted resources like stack overflow and W3schools. </p>

<h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Not really a method that I have used yet but im certainly not worried about doing so if I feel its the right thing to do and I am at a loose end. </p>

<h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Very happy to ask the coaches for help. I have had a few experiences already of dealing with the facilitators and they have been more than helpful. </p>

<h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px">I think this definitely helps cement ideas and concepts but I’m not sure if I have really used it as a problem solving method as such, although it does help me to gain awareness of my level of understanding of an issue. </p>
