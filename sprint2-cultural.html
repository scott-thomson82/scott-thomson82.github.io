		<h1>Core 2 Blog Post</h1>
		<h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
		<h4>23 November 2019</h4>
		<img src="images/sprint2-cultural.jpg" style="height:auto;width: 100%;" alt="Blog Image" class="center">


		<h2>Goals</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">My long term career goal is get a job in the tech as a software developer. I would
			like to work for a company who’s values are aligned with mine. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">In terms of human skills I would definitely like to work on public speaking, whether
			in large group situations or in presentations. </p>

		<h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">I am quite disciplined and determined. I don’t get flustered easily. Im good at
			planning and organising. Approachable and easy going. I am a big team player and really enjoy being around
			people and learning from them. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">I have a tendency to set high standard for myself so I will definitely need to work
			on when its the right time to leave something and move on. </p>

		<h2>Workload</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">For myself the key to managing the EDA workload will be about having a good system in
			place. Taking the time out to look over the programme, break it down, assess how long things will take and
			scheduling in the time to do it. I enjoy using task management and calendar tools so I will definitely be
			utilising these to aid me. Keeping too a routine and building habits will be very important. I like having
			regular work hours and knowing when it’s time to finish. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">Another key aspect is discussing the workload with my family and friends, making them
			aware that I will essentially be unavailable for social events over the next few weeks. </p>

		<h2>Support</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">What I would like from the facilitator team is guidance and support when needed.
			Regular honest feedback about what I could do differently or improve or if anything is offtrack. I am very
			receptive to feedback, even critical and will view it as an opportunity to learn. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">In terms of asking for help I will obviously attempt to solve the problem first
			myself. If it’s a technical problem the next step will be asking google to see if anyone else has had the
			same issue. Failing that I will then consult my facilitator or the group. I do like to try and work things
			out for myself so I may need to get a little bit better at asking for help if something is taking too long.
