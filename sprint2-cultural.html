		<h1>Sprint 2 Cultural Blog Post</h1>
		<h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
		<h4>23 November 2019</h4>
		<img src="images/sprint2-cultural.jpg" style="height:auto;width: 100%;" alt="Blog Image" class="center">


		<h2>Goals</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">My long term career goal is get a job in the tech as a software developer. I would
			like to work for a company who’s values are aligned with mine. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">In terms of human skills I would definitely like to work on public speaking, whether
			in large group situations or in presentations. </p>

		<h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">I am quite disciplined and determined. I don’t get flustered easily. Im good at
			planning and organising. Approachable and easy going. I am a big team player and really enjoy being around
			people and learning from them. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">I have a tendency to set high standard for myself so I will definitely need to work
			on when its the right time to leave something and move on. </p>

		<h2>Workload</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">For myself the key to managing the EDA workload will be about having a good system in
			place. Taking the time out to look over the programme, break it down, assess how long things will take and
			scheduling in the time to do it. I enjoy using task management and calendar tools so I will definitely be
			utilising these to aid me. Keeping too a routine and building habits will be very important. I like having
			regular work hours and knowing when it’s time to finish. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">Another key aspect is discussing the workload with my family and friends, making them
			aware that I will essentially be unavailable for social events over the next few weeks. </p>

		<h2>Support</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">What I would like from the facilitator team is guidance and support when needed.
			Regular honest feedback about what I could do differently or improve or if anything is offtrack. I am very
			receptive to feedback, even critical and will view it as an opportunity to learn. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">In terms of asking for help I will obviously attempt to solve the problem first
			myself. If it’s a technical problem the next step will be asking google to see if anyone else has had the
			same issue. Failing that I will then consult my facilitator or the group. I do like to try and work things
			out for myself so I may need to get a little bit better at asking for help if something is taking too long.

		<h1>Reassessing my Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h1>

		<h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">My long term career goal remains the same, I would like to get a job as a software developer. Im hoping that once i get more immersed in bootcamp I will be able to pinpoint which area of development I enjoy more and am more suited to. </p>

		<h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">Im a good team player and I have a lot of experience working and leading teams so I think this will definitely be one of my biggest strengths. In terms of limitations I think I will need to not get too worried about asking for help when its needed. </p>

		<h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">Some of the core material may be quite challenging. Im not really used to too much self-examination and reflection so this may be tough at first! </p>

		<h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">I would like to work on my presenting skills and also communication which definitely tie in together. </p>

		<h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">Be supportive when needed. I also think giving the right kind of feedback is very important. If I need a nudge in a certain area or there is anything I can do better or improve on I would like honest feedback about it. </p>

		<h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

		<p style="font-size: 20px">My expectation is to enter bootcamp with an open mind, learn as much as I can and take as much as I can away from the experience. Help others as much as I can and not be too hard on myself. </p>
