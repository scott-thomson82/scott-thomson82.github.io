	<h1>What is emotional intelligence?</h1>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">At a basic level emotional intelligence is an individuals capacity to recognise, understand and manage their
		emotions and to be aware of the emotions of others. We can break down emotional intelligence into five
		categories;</p>

	<ol style="font-size: 20px">
		<li>Self-awareness - recognising emotions when they happen</li>
		<li>Self-regulation - managing emotions</li>
		<li>Motivation - understanding your career drive</li>
		<li>Empathy - the ability to recognise how other people feel</li>
		<li>Social skills - awareness and development of interpersonal skills</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">IQ is an intelligence test score that aims to measure a persons cognitive ability. Some have suggested that an
		individuals success in school depends on their IQ but their success in life depends on their EQ. </p>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">It is also generally believed that you are born with your IQ level and that it is predominantly genetic but your
		EQ is something that is acquired and developed. </p>

	<h1>Why is EQ important?</h1>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">Emotional Intelligence has been shown to play an important role in career success, mental and physical health and
		relationships. The ability to understand and manage your emotions is an extremely important quality in the
		workplace. Communicating well with people, influencing them and understanding how they feel are valuable skills
		that will serve you well in both your professional and personal life. </p>
